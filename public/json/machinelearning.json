        "answer": "Fitting the model too closely to the training data",
        "description": "Overfitting occurs in machine learning when a model is trained too closely to the training data, capturing noise or random fluctuations. As a result, the model may perform well on the training data but generalize poorly to new, unseen data. Overfitting can be addressed by techniques such as regularization."
